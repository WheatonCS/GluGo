# GluGo
An integrated system of personalized diabetes management software, tools, and reports for patients wearing continuous glucose monitoring devices.

#Introduction
GluGo is a startup comprised of students at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. We prototype software applications that enable people living with diabetes to better control their glucose levels. We seek to improve how current apps interpret and display glucose data (e.g. interactive graphs), and improve alerts using algorithms that predict highs and lows before they occur. We also want to enable user include other data (e.g. carb intake) to serve the above ends. 

#Current Achievements and Future Goals
We currently have a fully integrated database, a web and phone app that both have interactive graphing functionality, a promising glucose prediction algorithm, and a website. Our phone app also enables users to annotate their data. 

Our most promising prediction algorithm requires testing on more datasets. In order to integrate the prediction algorithm we still need to determine a way to transmit sensor data to the database in real time. We also need implement the high/low alert system in our phone app. Finally, we aim to expand the visualization and statistical features of both apps.
